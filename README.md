DATA SCIENCE INTERNSHIP (TASK 3)
Project Title: Spam Email Classifier
Project Description: Create a machine learning model that can classify emails as spam or not spam (ham). This project will introduce you to text classification and binary classification tasks, commonly used in natural language processing (NLP).
Steps you can Implement:
Data Collection: Gather a dataset of emails labeled as spam or ham. You can find publicly available email datasets online, such as the Enron Spam Dataset or datasets on Kaggle.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the email data. This may involve removing special characters, lowercasing, tokenization, and removing stop words.
Feature Extraction: Convert the text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or Count Vectorization.
Label Encoding: Encode the target variable (spam/ham) as binary labels (1 for spam, 0 for ham).
Model Selection: Choose a machine learning algorithm for binary classification. Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are good choices for this task.

Data Split: Split your dataset into a training set and a testing set. Typically, use 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing.
Model Training: Train your chosen classification model on the training data, using the extracted features as input and the binary labels as the target variable.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters of the classification model to optimize its performance.
Deployment: Create a simple user interface where users can input an email text, and the model predicts whether it's spam or ham. You can build a command-line interface or a basic web application.
Documentation: Document your project, including the data source, preprocessing steps, model selection, and evaluation results. This documentation will help you communicate your findings and methods effectively.
